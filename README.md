Shark Attack Dataset: Cleaning, Transformation and Visualisation of Poor Quality Data


1. Project Description: 
This project focuses on cleaning, transforming and visualizing a dataset containing information about shark attacks. The original data attempts to be a log of shark attacks throughout the ages and contains several features related to the attacks, such as the date, location, information about the victim, and the type of shark involved. However, there are many data quality issues, such as missing values and inconsistencies, which this project aims to improve.
We use the python library pandas to manipulate, clean and transform the data and do some initial analysis and visualization of the cleaned dataset using the plotting library Matplotlib.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation Steps:
In this project, we perform several cleaning steps to improve the quality of the data, such as:
- Removing duplicate rows
- Removing almost empty rows
- Removing or filling missing values in columns
- Standardizing age and date columns
- Creating new columns based on existing information


3. Data Analysis and Visualisation:
After completing the previous steps, we use the cleaned dataset to perform an initial analysis of the data. We explore possible relationships between variables and create informative plots to better visualise them. This initial analysis aims to provide a foundation for further in-depth investigations.
